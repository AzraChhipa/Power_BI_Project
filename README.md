# Power_BI_Project
Power BI Developer portfolio featuring Cookie Sales, Global Superstore, and HR Analytics dashboards. Demonstrates data modeling, Power Query (ETL), advanced DAX (CALCULATE, RANKX, Time Intelligence), KPI development, and interactive reporting. Built scalable, insight-driven dashboards for data-driven decision making.
This repository showcases three end-to-end Power BI analytical dashboard projects: Cookie Sales Analysis, Global Superstore Analysis, and HR Analytics Dashboard. Each project demonstrates strong expertise in data modeling, Power Query transformations, DAX calculations, and interactive dashboard design.

The dashboards include KPI tracking, time intelligence analysis, profit and sales performance evaluation, workforce analytics, attrition insights, and dynamic filtering using slicers and drill-through features. Advanced DAX measures such as calculated columns, measures, time-based aggregations, percentage growth, and conditional logic were implemented to derive business insights.

These projects reflect my ability to transform raw datasets into meaningful business intelligence solutions using data modeling best practices, star schema relationships, and optimized DAX performance techniques.

**Cookie Sales Analysis Dashboard**
Focused on sales performance monitoring, revenue trends, product-wise contribution, and profitability analysis. Implemented KPIs such as Total Sales, Total Profit, Profit Margin %, and MoM Growth using DAX measures. Applied time intelligence functions (TOTALYTD, SAMEPERIODLASTYEAR) for trend analysis. Data cleaning and transformation were performed using Power Query Editor.

**Global Superstore Dashboard**
Designed a multi-page executive dashboard analyzing Sales, Profit, Orders, Shipping Performance, and Regional Trends. Built a proper data model with relationships between fact and dimension tables. Created calculated measures for YoY Growth, Category Contribution %, Top N Analysis, and dynamic ranking using RANKX. Used drill-through, bookmarks, slicers, and tooltips for enhanced interactivity.

**HR Analytics Dashboard**
Developed an HR insights dashboard focusing on employee attrition, department-wise performance, salary distribution, job roles, and hiring trends. Implemented DAX measures for Attrition Rate %, Active Employees, Average Salary, and Workforce Demographics analysis. Applied conditional formatting and dynamic filtering to improve decision-making visibility.
